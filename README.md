<font size=2>Second programming assignment for deep learning practice:</font>  
Read the paper of LeNet、AlexNet、ResNet and compare the differences and connections between them.Comparative tests are carried out on the basis of Resnet.
------
## 1. ResNet
This experiment was performed on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset with a image size of 32x32.So I use a shallow network ResNet18.

## 2. Dropout

## 3. LRN
